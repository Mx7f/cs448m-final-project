Small Braille Plotter 
Michael Mara and Mari Lliguicota

Goal
What do you want to be able to make?
We would like to make a braille generator machine that is lightweight, inexpensive, and easy to carry. With the machine, we would like to write haikus in braille. 

Description
Inspired by the DrawBot Badge plotter and by OpenBraille, we aim to build a small braille generating machine. We intend to use the DrawBot Badge plotter's drawing mechanism and a custom built pad with grid indentations. 

What is innovative about proposal?

Embossing machines used to create braille are expensive and wide. Our machine will be smaller than your average printer. The size of the machine and the ability to create braille is what is innovative about the proposal.

What do you think will be the hardest part of the project?

The hardest part of the project would be implementing the drawing mechanism used by DrawBot Badge and creating the right amount of pressure to create a dot. 

Responsibilities
Mari 
* Create custom grid pad inspired by roller in large braille generator (See reference 1)
* Create physical writing platform that will hold the pad
* Find tool/pin to create dot

Michael
* Print pieces for drawing mechanism
* Math for moving drawing mechanism
* Software to create braille

Mari & Michael
* Build drawing mechanism
* Combine drawing mechanism with platform

Plan & Milestones
6/1: Drawing mechanism and start software
6/4: First prototype assembled which will be able to draw dots but pressure may not be right
6/6: Pressure for embossing improved
6/8: Final prototype
6/10: Presentation

* 3 Micro servos
* 3D printed parts for drawing mechanism
* 3D printed parts for base
* Round Pin or tool to use for embossing
* Arduino Uno
* Custom build grid pad to help with embossing
* Cardstock
* Cam to lift pin
* USB cable
* Wires 
* Power Supply
* Sturdy material for platform/base
* (2) M2 x 8mm screws
* (3) 2.6mm x 0.45 screw
* (2) M3x10mm
* (1) M3x14mm 
* (1) M3 washer
* 14mm screw
